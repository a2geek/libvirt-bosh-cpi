# Libvirt Configuration

Storage space must be allocated to store stemcells and disk images used by the BOSH CPI. 

The following XML defines the bosh pool to be used, assuming that the `default` pool will not be used. See the [libvirt documentation for the storage pool XML](https://libvirt.org/formatstorage.html) for details.

```
<pool type='dir'>
  <name>bosh-pool</name>
  <target>
    <path>/var/lib/libvirt/bosh-images</path>
    <permissions>
      <mode>0711</mode>
      <owner>0</owner>
      <group>0</group>
    </permissions>
  </target>
</pool>
```

Once the location, name, and settings are completed, the following commands will setup the pool and ultimately list details for confirmation:

```
# Run all of these from 'virsh'
pool-define ./libvirt-bosh-storage-pool.xml
pool-build bosh-pool
pool-start bosh-pool
pool-autostart bosh-pool
pool-list
pool-info bosh-pool
```

Sample session:

```
